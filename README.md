## <a name="intro"></a>Introduction

From https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/:

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

> Features

> Create stand-alone Spring applications

> Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

> Provide opinionated 'starter' POMs to simplify your Maven configuration

> Automatically configure Spring whenever possible

> Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks and externalized configuration

> Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
